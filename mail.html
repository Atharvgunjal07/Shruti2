    <p>To Shrutika Kharade,</p>
    <p> (my kuski from KoparKhairne )</p>
    <p> So I just made this in like 2 hours for idk why, you are turning 21 tomorrow like wow. 
        when i entered my 20s it was a whole new feeling but yeah you are 10 months elder so my mommy hehe!
        turning 21 now, knowing you will enter a new chapter is a whole new challenge ig and that too in exams 
        toh just wow and sad. i know you are someone who gets excited yes you do but at the same time you dont want 
        others to know that you get excited, you want to be free but at the same time remain a mystery, maybe even 
        dance off the floor but also remain quite and shy in a corner, in short i have descirved be in some way. 
        hehe cannot blame we both are so similar. you are wonderful everyday i talk to you i dont get bored honestly 
        ha i tend to sleep but that is because i am wayyy to comfortbale,. you have a wonderful family one with values 
        and drama haha classics! but yeah you still bind together in the end all of you. and yeah i am scared at times 
        for i dont want to loose you ever. i am addicted to you quite literally. i know sounds stupid i know.  
        you are special to me in many ways cause i have felt this connect with you which is instant. 
        yeah you are difficult at times i have to admit that but that is who you are and that i acccept. i love you the 
        way you are! that is the baseline from where i think the line should be drawn for thinking further.  
    </p>
    <p> there are so many things which i dont have the answer about at the moment on wh, how and just freaking 
        is it real? i even pinch myself sometimes by the fact that it is not real! hahah i am GRATEFUL to have you in my 
        life at the moment. idc what anyone says or thinks of me as long as you are there with me and we are having the 
        time of our lives together! 
        just imagine who could have imagined us? its very unreal actually. thining of the first days i saw you and how 
        important and integral part of my life you have become. like INDISPENSABLE at times. I can move mountains for you 
        yes! i can say that cause maybe i look back at my past and this has been the most daring time of my life. 
        but it is something I CHOOOSE. you didnt lead me to anything or even think about it for the matter of fact.
    </p>
    <p> i love us together every moment that we have had, evry picture, every time i have touched your skin,
        grabbed your hand, patted you, fixed your hair, played with your hair, kissed, fingered, lusted, loved, cared, 
        looked around for you, misses you, longed for you...yes maybe i have gone crazy in a way i admit. 
        but yeah i know its Shruti who is similar but also different to me in many ways, we look very cute together 
        always have and always will. the moment you come anytime lights up my day and makes it something to look forward to. 
        you make me a better person, better performer, better lover and yeah most importantly you make me feel something. 
        there is a lot more i can say and i think you know all about it, i am forever grateful to have you in my life 
        and i will rejoice every moment, and yes PLAN A was getting together with you, pretty much the day maybe i had 
        realised how much i had fell for you. I was and I am so in LOVE WITH YOU. 
        ok ok you know a lot about us already. 
    </p>
